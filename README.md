===============

My name is Sara Millar and these are projects that I have made for various classes at UCSD. All of these projects were written individually.

Game of Life Android App
------------------------
This was my final project for my ICAM 141A class (Computer Programming and the Arts I). It simulates [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_life). The project was completed between January 2012 and March 2012.

Form Art Android App
--------------------
I made this application in my ICAM 141A class (Computer Programming and the Arts I). It is artwork made up of android-native form elements, inspired by [Form Art](http://www.c3.hu/collection/form/). The project was completed between January 2012 and March 2012.
