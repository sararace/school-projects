My Projects
===============

My name is Sara Millar and these are projects that I have made for various classes at UCSD. These projects were written individually.

Game of Life Android App
------------------------
This was my final project for my ICAM 141A class (Computer Programming and the Arts I). It simulates [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_life). The project was completed between January 2012 and March 2012.

Form Art Android App
--------------------
I made this application in my ICAM 141A class (Computer Programming and the Arts I). It is artwork made up of android-native form elements, inspired by [Form Art](http://www.c3.hu/collection/form/). The project was completed between January 2012 and March 2012.

Other Projects
==============

These are group projects that I contrbuted to for various classes at UCSD.

GymBuddy
--------
[GymBuddy](https://github.com/mkoonce/gymbuddy) was our final project for COGS 120 (Human Computer Interaction). During this project, we found a user need, tested several prototypes, then created this Node App that is optimized for use on mobile devices.
