My Projects
===============

My name is Sara Millar and these are projects that I have made for various classes at UCSD. These projects were written individually.

Game of Life Android App
------------------------
This was my final project for my ICAM 141A class (Computer Programming and the Arts I). It simulates [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_life). The project was completed between January 2012 and March 2012.

Form Art Android App
--------------------
I made this application in my ICAM 141A class (Computer Programming and the Arts I). It is artwork made up of android-native form elements, inspired by [Form Art](http://www.c3.hu/collection/form/). The project was completed between January 2012 and March 2012.

Other Projects
==============

These are group projects that I contrbuted to for various classes at UCSD.

BidIt Android App
-----------------
[BidIt](https://github.com/aluon/cse190) was our final project for CSE 190 (Introduction to Mobile and Server Programming). This app would allow users to post items they wanted to sell, and other users could browse the posted items in a convenient swipable list, as well as bid on any items they liked by sending a private message to the owner.

GymBuddy Mobile Web App
-----------------------
[GymBuddy](https://github.com/mkoonce/gymbuddy) was our final project for COGS 120 (Human Computer Interaction). During this project, we found a user need, tested several prototypes, then created this Node App that is optimized for use on mobile devices.
